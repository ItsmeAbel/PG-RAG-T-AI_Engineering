# PG-RAG-TC(Production Grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Tool Calling)
A production-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with tool calling, vector search, and evaluation, designed to minimize hallucinations and operate under real-world constraints.

# Tech stack
- Code: python
- Api: FASTAPI
- Framework: Langchain
- Vector DB: FAISS
- LLM: Gemeni
- Storage: SQLite, Json, Meta
- Evaluation: Python scripts

# Preliminary Building process
Retrieve Data -> Chunking -> Embedding -> Embeddings get adding to Vector DB -> RAG -> MCP
